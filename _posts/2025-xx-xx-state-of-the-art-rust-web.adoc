:page-navtitle: State of the art web-app in rust

== Technologies used
Let's start with where you're writing rust code:

* Axum or Leptos (with Axum as backend)
* Diesel ORM
* Tower (if you need your own networking connections or custom services)
** Tonic (for gRPC over HTTP/2)

== Why does this matter
This is (perhaps) a state-of-the-art webapp using some of the latest but standardized (and adopted) technologies (HTTP/2, WASM, Server-Side-Rendering).

== An example project

TBD

== Bonus

If you were making an app, using flutter with the rust-bridge is a small tweak to the above list.
