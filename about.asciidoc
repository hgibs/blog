I write this blog to organize my thoughts and while I hope that someone finds them useful, I am content with them only having 1 reader - me, but if you want to read it that would be swell üòÅ.

I am a soldier (6 years in the US Army, although I got out a handful of years ago), a father, a man with too many interests, and a software engineer.
I've been an infantry officer, DevOps engineer, Tech Lead, ML Engineer, and backend engineer.
The thing I like most (besides my lovely wife) is building things with software.
The thing I find most fulfilling (professionally) getting difficult people to work as a part of a team.

I'm not really sure where this blog will go, if anywhere, so please let me know if you have comments: author (at) blog.hollandgibson.com
