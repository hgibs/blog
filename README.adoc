:page-description: A forkable blog-ready Jekyll site using AsciiDoc

== TODO
* finish importing site from the high-performance blog
* make sure all asciidoc stuff gets formatted correctly
* pull in the al-folio features:
** redirects
* swap to https://www.linyangchen.com/Typography-Fell-Types-font font
* add a script to update front-matter with better page.date info
* add a modified time?

== To build locally

[source, shell]
----
./devlocal.sh
----

== Deploying
Should be as easy as merging to `main` so CI can handle it.
Circle-CI and cloudflare work together on this one.

For now, any commit to `main` gets picked up by cloudflare pages and gets published.

== About this site
This site started from https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc-quickstart
Then I took inspiration from https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio and https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog and https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master
